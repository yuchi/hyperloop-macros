Hyperloop Macros
================

[Sweet.js][sjs] macros to accelerate Hyperloop development.

By now only utilities for Objective-C were implemented;

[sjs]: http://sweetjs.org/

## Installation

```bash
# Install in your project
npm install --save-dev hyperloop-macros
# Compile your source
sjs my_hyperloop_source.js --module hyperloop-macros/obj-c
```

## Usage

### Common

```js
// Activate Hyperloop for this file
use hyperloop;
```

### Objective-C

```js
// The `native` keyword makes the class compile to Hyperloop
class native LocDelegate
  // For clarity `implements` is (also) aliased as extends
  extends NSObject
  // Protocol the class responds to
  protocol CLLocationManagerDelegate {

  // Objective-C style message definition (copy-paste-proof)
  - (void) locationManager:(CLLocationManager *) locationManager
        didUpdateLocations:(NSArray *) locations {

    // Casting is done with the `as` keyword, but for arguments is not necessary
    var locationsRecasted = locations as (NSArray *);

    // Message passing is activated with `@` in dot-notation style
    locationManager@startUpdatingLocation();

    // Since the second argument we follow Swiftâ€™s form
    locationManager@allowDeferredLocationUpdatesUntilTraveled(null, timeout: null);
  }
}
```
